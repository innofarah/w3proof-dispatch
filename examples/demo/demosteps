1. publish-signed basic + import cid in order
2. publish order + import cid in monotone
3. publish fibonacci
4. get-execution cidfib -> thms in basic should be skipped

------

from above
1. publish-signed monotone + import cid in fibonacci
2. publish fibonacci
3. get-execution cidfib -> only thms in fib should not be skipped + we would have 2 keys as 2 assertions exist in the structure
